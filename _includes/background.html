    <p>I'm a first year student at <a href="https://www.cuchd.in" target="_blank">Chandigarh University</a> in Punjab studying Mater of computer applications in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Specialization. I have experience in working with Android Open source project, graphic and UI/UX designing. I strive to create AI & ML models, and designs, with pixel-perfect user experiences.</p>

    <p>I love learning new and better ways to create robust AI & ML models because it allows me to combine the logical parts of my brain with my clean, efficient, and scalable code. I consider work an ongoing education, and I'm always looking for opportunities to work with those who are willing to share their knowledge as much as I want to learn. At the end of the day, my primary goal is to create something beautiful with people that bring out the best in me.</p>
    
    <p>When I'm not in front of a mac, you can probably find me reading books, or traveling to a new place on my bucket list!</p>
